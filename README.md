git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Compile the smart contract:
```bash
npx scrypt-cli@latest compile
```

4. Start the development server:

```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
